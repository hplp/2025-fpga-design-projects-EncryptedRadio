## Objective & Motivation

The goal of this project is to create a secure data transmission system using FPGAs. By combining AES encryption with UART serial communication and HC-12 transceiver modules, we built a functional encrypted radio communication pipeline using the PYNQ-Z1 FPGA board.

This project explores the intersection of hardware cryptography and embedded wireless communication.

## Introduction

### Background

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a fast and secure symmetric-key encryption algorithm. UART is a widely-used, reliable communication protocol for serial data exchange. Together, they enable secure wireless communication over constrained embedded systems.

We utilized AES for data encryption/decryption and UART for interfacing with the HC-12 radio module. Communication is handled by hardware IP blocks and a custom C application running on the ZYNQ PS.

### AES Encryption Overview

AES operates on 128-bit blocks and performs the following sequence:

1. **AddRoundKey** â€” XOR plaintext with round key  
2. **SubBytes** â€” Apply S-box substitution  
3. **ShiftRows** â€” Cyclically shift rows of the state  
4. **MixColumns** â€” Matrix multiplication in GF(2^8) *(skipped in final round)*  
5. **AddRoundKey** â€” Apply another round key

This is repeated for a total of 10 rounds for AES-128.

### Serial Communication Flow

#### Transmit Pipeline
- User inputs text in PC serial terminal
- Data is buffered (16-byte blocks)
- Each block is encrypted via AES-128 hardware IP
- Transmitted to HC-12 radio module via UART

#### Receive Pipeline
- Encrypted block is received over UART from HC-12
- Decrypted using AES hardware peripheral
- Plaintext is displayed on the terminal
