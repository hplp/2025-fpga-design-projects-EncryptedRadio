2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on uart_rtl_rxd relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning

An output delay is missing on uart_rtl_txd relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_0
Related violations: <none>

RTGT-1#1 Advisory
RAM retargeting possibility  
Identified 6 RAM32X1D primitives that could be retargeted to RAM32M. Retargeting will save approximately 2 memory LUTs and improve routability. These can usually be achieved using synthesis inference or XPMs. The memories are Zynq_CPU_i/AES_Full_0/inst/CRTLS_s_axi_U/int_data_out/mem_reg_0_3_0_0,
